brief explanation of the technologies I used:

expo, 
  to install envirnoment for coding the app

firebase,
  for online database to share info between users

asyncstorage,
  to save state of the last search term used with phone, but didn't work as well as planned.

react-redux,
  to keep data well handled across different navigation screens

react-navigation,
  handling different views across the app

react-native-maps,
  setting and getting coordinates for events
